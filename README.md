# Hello-World
Creating a members Society to protect personal freedoms for everyone anywhere. 
Life has granted me with a very unique view on the world. I have never been able take anything at face value always asking WHY when anyone tried to exsert athority over me. I found my self at odds with athority figure my entire life, even knowing i was in the right. I have managed to overcome the labels and branding that has clouded me much of my life. I found my reason why i traveled the very crazy road in life that unfolded my understanding of a great many facts about Freedom. Leading me to my personal life mission creating a society to protect the personal rights for every person on this planet. Much of the information i have collected runs contrary with the infomation shared with the general public. Yet once a person starts seeking truth and asks the why question they will see clearly where the lies have removed real freedom and human rights.
However this information i will present is all easy to confirm quickly others will see why the society is of vital important to the living breathing souls on the planet to come together as a collective.
